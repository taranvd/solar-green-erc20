# Dexola Solidity Bootcamp
</h1>





## Project Description

This repository contains the implementation of the test task for participation in the Dexola Solidity Bootcamp. The project includes smart contracts for token issuance and sale, implemented using the Solidity programming language and ERC20 standard.



## Main Tasks

1. **ERC20 Token Implementation:**
   - Creation and initialization of an ERC20 token with the ability to add and remove users from the blacklist.
   - Use of the OpenZeppelin library to ensure contract security and reliability.

2. **Token Sale Contract Implementation:**
   - Creation of a contract for token sale, where the administrator can set the price and sale parameters.
   - Limit on the number of tokens that can be purchased in a single transaction.

## Technologies Used

- Solidity
- OpenZeppelin
